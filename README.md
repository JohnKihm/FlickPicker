# Movie-Finder
This is the ✨Movie-Finder✨. Are you looking for particular actor and/or director? Then this is
great tool for you! Just enter the genre your interested in, the year of release, name of the actor and director,
 and the rotten tomatoes score. When you have entered all those prerequisites you should be met with a catalog film 
listing the the name of the film, the date of film, and any awards or nominations the film may have received.
Hopefully this tool can help you search for that obscure film you have been looking for.
